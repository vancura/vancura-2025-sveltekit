# Hello World

This is my first blog post written in MDX. MDX allows me to use Svelte components directly in my markdown content.

## Why MDX?

MDX combines the power of markdown with the flexibility of JSX. This means you can:

- Write content in an easy-to-read format
- Import and use components directly in your content
- Apply styling and interactive elements with ease

```js
// Example code block
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

And here's how you might use a component in MDX:

```svelte
<Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>
```
